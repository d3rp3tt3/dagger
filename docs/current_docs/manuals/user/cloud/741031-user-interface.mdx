# User Interface
:::info
Dagger 0.11.0 adds support for visualizing Dagger Functions calls in Dagger Cloud. With this update, Dagger Cloud will default to the use the new Traces experience for both `dagger call` and `dagger run` commands. Engines running Dagger 0.11.0 or later will automatically use the new Traces experience. Engines running Dagger 0.10.0 or earlier will continue to use the legacy Runs experience.
:::

Dagger Cloud visualizes your Dagger pipelines runs invoked from your local dev machine and in CI. 

A run is an invocation of a Dagger pipeline. When you run Dagger in CI, each call aligns with one run in Dagger Cloud. If you have many CI jobs configured to run for every pull/merge request, you may see several runs for a single commit.

For instance, if 4 GitHub Actions workflows each call Dagger to run a pipeline for pull requessts, you will see four distinct runs in the Dagger Cloud UI. You may also see multiple runs if one GitHub workflow has multiple jobs defined with distinct calls to Dagger to run your pipelines. As you Daggerize your pipelines, you will likely have fewer distinct CI workflows.

Because Dagger Cloud understands the Dagger engine's data model, it gives you visibility into the steps of your pipeline's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), including detailed logs for each step.

## Traces
:::info
You will only see runs in the **Traces** view if you are using Dagger 0.11.0 or later. If you are using an older version of Dagger, you will see runs in the **Runs** view.
:::

:::note
Dagger **Traces** is still under development and is in Beta. We welcome your feedback on how we can improve this page. Please join the [Dagger Discord](https://discord.gg/dagger-io) to join the Dagger community and share your feedback.
:::

The **Traces** page lists runs you've triggered from your local development host or in CI.

(ADD SCREENSHOT OF TRACES PAGE HERE)

Here's a quick summary of what you'll see for each trace.

|Field | Description |
|---|---|
|Status icon | Indication of run success or failure |
|Command | The exact command used to invoke your pipeline |
|Start | Run start time |
|Duration | Run duration |

:::info
The **Traces** view does not yet include metadata for the user, branch, remote, or commit. We are working on adding this metadata to the Traces view.
:::

### Trace Details page
You can drill down into the details of a specific trace by clicking it. This directs you to a run-specific **Trace Details** page.

(ADD SCREENSHOT OF TRACE DETAILS PAGE HERE)

The **Trace Details** page includes detailed status and duration metadata about the pipeline steps. The tree view shows Dagger pipelines and steps within those pipelines. If there are any errors in the run, Dagger Cloud automatically brings you to the first error in the list. You see detailed logs and output of each step, making it easy for you to debug your pipelines and collaborate with your teammates.

A Dagger trace shows a detailed timeline for operations completed in a pipeline run. Dagger Cloud also applies unique IDs and icons for related operations, which are essential for debugging your pipeline when something does wrong.

### All Runs page
:::info
The All Runs view only applies to pipeline runs done with Dagger versions older than v0.11.0. This view has been replaced by the new **Traces** view in Dagger Cloud.
:::

The **All Runs** page lists runs you've kicked off from your local dev machine and CI.

![View runs](/img/current_docs/manuals/user/cloud/user-interface/all-runs.png)

Here's a quick summary of what you'll see for each run.

|Field | Description |
|---|---|
|Status | Indication of run success or failure |
|Title | Title of the pull request or Change or commit title (abbreviated) |
|Commit |Git commit ID |
|Change | Reference to the pull request or merge request your in source code repository |
|Start | Run start time |
|Duration | Run duration |
|User | User triggering the run |
|Runner Job | Run ID (first 8 identifying bytes) |
|Branch | Name of the branch in source code repository |
|Remote | Full path to the remote source code repository |

:::tip
You can display a subset of runs, such as runs related to a specific commit, branch, user or remote, by clicking the *Filter* icon in the corresponding field of the run list.

### Run Details page

You can drill down into the details of a specific run by clicking it. This directs you to a run-specific **Run Details** page. When you run Dagger locally, this is the page you visit when you click the Dagger Cloud link in the CLI output.

![View run details](/img/current_docs/manuals/user/cloud/user-interface/run-details.png)

The **Run Details** page includes detailed status and duration metadata about the pipeline steps. The tree view shows Dagger pipelines and steps within those pipelines. If there are any errors in the run, Dagger Cloud automatically brings you to the first error in the list. You see detailed logs and output of each step, making it easy for you to debug your pipelines and collaborate with your teammates.

### Run Details: Step viewer
Clicking into a specific step will open a drawer with several elements that can help you debug why your pipeline is failing and help you identify why a step might not have been cached.

## Changes
:::info
The **Changes** views only apply to pipeline runs done with Dagger versions older than v0.11.0. These views have been replaced by the new **Traces** views in Dagger Cloud.
:::

A change is a group of runs for a specific commit or pull/merge request.

### All Changes page

The **All Changes** page lists available groups.

Here's a quick summary of what you'll see for each change.

|Field | Description |
|---|---|
|Status | Indication of run success or failure |
|Title | Change or commit title (abbreviated) |
|Commit | Commit ID |
|Change | Reference to change in source code repository |
|Start | Run start time |
|Duration | Run duration |
|User | User triggering the run |
|Runner Job | Run ID (first 8 identifying bytes) |
|Branch | Name of the branch in source code repository |
|Remote | Full path to the remote source code repository |


### Change Details page
You can drill down into the details of a specific change by clicking it. This directs you to a **Change Details** page, as shown below:

![View change details](/img/current_docs/manuals/user/cloud/user-interface/change-details.png)

The *Change Details* page lists all the pipeline runs for the commit or pull request. The tree view shows Dagger pipelines and detailed logs of steps and outputs within those pipelines. Clicking into a run takes you to the [run's details page](user-interface#run-details-page).
