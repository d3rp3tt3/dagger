## Debug with Traces
Dagger Cloud's Traces feature allows you to see the execution path of your Dagger calls in real-time. This is useful for debugging and understanding how your Dagger pipeline is being executed.

Once your run has completed, you can view the Traces tab in the run details page. This tab shows a visual representation of the execution path of your Dagger calls. You can see the order in which the calls were executed, as well as the time taken for each call.

In the following example, we'll debug a failure with a Dagger pipeline using Traces.
